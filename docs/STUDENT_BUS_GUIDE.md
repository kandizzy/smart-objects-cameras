# Smart Classroom Bus — Student Guide

**This is your finals assignment.**
Your project must connect to the classroom event bus and leave evidence that it
can participate in the room.

---

## What you need to submit

| What | How to verify |
|------|---------------|
| Your project is registered on the bus | It appears on `/projects/readiness` |
| Your project sent a heartbeat | `has_heartbeat: true` in the readiness table |
| Your project emitted at least one event | `event_count > 0` in the readiness table |
| Your project consumed and responded to at least one event | Visible in `/showcase/report` |

**The bus records evidence even when hardware fails.**
A mock heartbeat + one mock event counts. Your grade is based on the interaction
design — did the room know your project existed and did your project respond to
the room?

---

## Scoring (5 points total)

| Score | What it means |
|-------|---------------|
| 1/5 | Project is registered (has declared events) |
| 2/5 | Contract exists (consumes and emits declared) |
| 3/5 | **Heartbeat sent** + at least one event in the bus |
| 4/5 | Contract + heartbeat + event (full loop demonstrated) |
| 5/5 | **Live at critique** + contract + event |

Minimum passing: **3/5**. Target: **5/5** — be live when Carrie opens the report.

---

## The server address

All examples use `http://localhost:8766`.
If you are connecting from your own laptop (not the machine running the server),
replace `localhost` with the classroom IP that Carrie gives you, e.g.
`http://192.168.1.55:8766`.

The API key is `testkey` for everyone.

---

## Step 1 — Find your project

Check the readiness table:

```
http://CLASSROOM_IP:8766/projects/readiness
```

Find your `project_id` in the list. If your project shows `needs-heartbeat`,
go to Step 2 now.

Your personal packet (with the exact command to run):

```
http://localhost:8766/projects/YOUR_PROJECT_ID/packet.md
```

---

## Step 2 — Send a heartbeat (pick one)

### Option A — Browser (no code, works on any computer)

Open:

```
http://CLASSROOM_IP:8766/heartbeat
```

Fill in your Project ID, select what your project Consumes and Emits, and click
**Send Heartbeat**. This is enough to move from `needs-heartbeat` to `stale`.

### Option B — Python script (recommended)

```bash
set CLASSROOM_API=http://CLASSROOM_IP:8766
set PROJECT_ID=YOUR_PROJECT_ID
set PROJECT_API_KEY=testkey
set CAPABILITIES=YOUR_CAPABILITY_1,YOUR_CAPABILITY_2
set CONSUMES=event_type_you_listen_for
set EMITS=event_type_you_send_back
python classroom-api/student_heartbeat.py
```

Leave this running. It sends a heartbeat every 30 seconds so you show as **live**
at critique time.

### Option C — curl (if Python isn't available)

```bash
curl -X POST http://localhost:8766/projects/YOUR_PROJECT_ID/heartbeat \
  -H "Content-Type: application/json" \
  -H "X-API-Key: testkey" \
  -d "{\"status\":\"online\",\"capabilities\":[\"YOUR_CAPABILITY\"],\"consumes\":[\"room_mode_change\"],\"emits\":[\"your.event\"],\"message\":\"my project is alive\"}"
```

---

## Step 3 — Emit at least one event

Even if your hardware is not working, publish a mock event:

```bash
curl -X POST http://localhost:8766/projects/YOUR_PROJECT_ID/events \
  -H "Content-Type: application/json" \
  -H "X-API-Key: testkey" \
  -d "{\"event_type\":\"YOUR_EVENT\",\"payload\":{\"message\":\"mock event — hardware not ready\"}}"
```

Or use `student_template.py`:

```python
publish_event("your.event", {"status": "mock"})
```

---

## Step 4 — Verify you are done

Open the report:

```
http://CLASSROOM_IP:8766/showcase/report
```

Find your project in the table. You should see:

- `level`: `live` (if you're still running) or `stale` (if you ran earlier)
- `has_heartbeat`: `true`
- `event_count`: 1 or more

If you see that, you're done.

---

## Step 5 — Stay live at critique

Keep the heartbeat script running while the professor goes through the report.
The live window is **2 minutes** — the script re-sends every 30 seconds,
so you need to be running for the whole critique.

## Per-project starter prompts for Claude Code

Below are prompts you can paste directly into Claude Code to build your
bus integration. Each prompt produces a runnable Python script.

### seren-room — Yuxuan (Seren)

```
I'm building "A Room", a context-aware classroom ambience system.
My project ID on the classroom bus is "seren-room".
The bus API is at http://localhost:8766, API key is "testkey".

Using classroom-api/student_template.py as a base, write a Python script that:

1. Imports the heartbeat, publish_event, and subscribe_to_events functions
   from student_template.py (or copies them inline).
2. Sends a heartbeat on startup declaring:
   - capabilities: ["ambience", "ambience.changed", "room.adapted"]
   - consumes: ["person_change", "probe_classification", "room_mode_change"]
   - emits: ["ambience.changed", "room.adapted"]
3. Subscribes to SSE events at /subscribe/events?subscriber_id=seren-room
4. When a room_mode_change event arrives:
   - mode "lecture" or "focus"     → publish ambience.changed with {"mode": "focus", "intensity": 0.6}
   - mode "group" or "activity"    → publish ambience.changed with {"mode": "warm", "intensity": 0.8}
   - mode "empty"                  → publish ambience.changed with {"mode": "off", "intensity": 0.0}
   - any other mode                → publish room.adapted with {"adaptation": mode, "reason": "room shifted"}
5. Prints every event received and every event emitted with a timestamp.
6. Re-sends the heartbeat every 90 seconds in a background thread.

Run it with:
    set PROJECT_ID=seren-room
    set PROJECT_API_KEY=testkey
    set CLASSROOM_API=http://CLASSROOM_IP:8766
    python seren_room.py

Verify it works by running mock_classroom_driver.py in another terminal and
watching the printed output.
```

   - emits: ["forest.mood_set", "forest.pulse"]
2. Subscribes to SSE events at /subscribe/events?subscriber_id=forest-classroom
3. On person_change:
   - new_count > 10 → publish forest.mood_set with {"mood": "active", "intensity": 0.9}
   - new_count > 3  → publish forest.mood_set with {"mood": "present", "intensity": 0.7}
   - new_count == 0 → publish forest.mood_set with {"mood": "empty", "intensity": 0.1}
4. On room_mode_change:
   - mode "lecture"  → publish forest.mood_set with {"mood": "quiet", "intensity": 0.3}
   - mode "activity" → publish forest.pulse with {"count": payload.get("total_persons", 0)}
5. Prints each event received and emitted.
6. Re-sends heartbeat every 90 seconds.

Verify by running mock_classroom_driver.py and checking
http://CLASSROOM_IP:8766/showcase/report for forest-classroom events.
```

   - new_class "discussion"   → publish beam.off with {"reason": "group mode"}
4. On room_mode_change:
   - mode "lecture"  → publish beam.pointed with {"x": 0.5, "y": 0.2, "focus": "whiteboard"}
   - mode "activity" → publish beam.off with {"reason": "activity mode"}
   - mode "empty"    → publish beam.off with {"reason": "room empty"}
5. Prints each event received and emitted.
6. Re-sends heartbeat every 90 seconds.

Verify by running mock_classroom_driver.py and watching beam events appear in
http://localhost:8766/projects/focus-beam/events

5. Prints each event received and emitted.
6. Re-sends heartbeat every 90 seconds.

Verify by running mock_classroom_driver.py — it triggers both whiteboard_change
and fiducial.detected events which imprint should respond to.
```

### gesture-timer

```
I'm building a "Gesture Classroom Timer" that responds to timer offers from the
room and starts/stops a visible countdown.
My project ID is "gesture-timer".

## How to run a full integration test

1. In terminal 1, start the API:

   ```bash
   CLASSROOM_API_KEY=testkey python classroom_api.py   # run from classroom-api/
   ```

2. In terminal 2, start your project script (or the heartbeat):

   ```bash
   set PROJECT_ID=seren-room
   set PROJECT_API_KEY=testkey
   python my_project.py
   ```

3. In terminal 3, run the mock classroom driver:

   ```bash
   CLASSROOM_API_URL=http://localhost:8766 CLASSROOM_API_KEY=testkey \
   python classroom-api/mock_classroom_driver.py --speed 3
   ```

4. Watch your project's output — it should print events it received
   and events it emitted.

5. Open the report:

   ```
   http://CLASSROOM_IP:8766/showcase/report
   ```

   Find your project. Check:
   - `level: live` (shows green)
   - `event_count: N` (shows your emitted events)

6. Open your project's packet for a summary:

   ```
   http://localhost:8766/projects/YOUR_PROJECT_ID/packet.md
   ```

## Troubleshooting

**"I get a connection error"**
The API isn't running. Start it first:
```bash
CLASSROOM_API_KEY=testkey python classroom_api.py   # run from classroom-api/
```

**"My heartbeat works but I'm still stale"**
Stale is fine — it means you checked in before. To show as `live`, keep the
heartbeat script running during critique (it refreshes every 30 seconds).

**"My project isn't showing up"**
Use the exact `project_id` from the roster above. Typos create new entries.
Check the readiness table: `http://CLASSROOM_IP:8766/projects/readiness`

**"The mock driver ran but I see no events for my project"**
Your project needs to subscribe to the SSE stream and respond.
Check that your `subscribe_to_events` callback is working.
Alternatively, publish a mock event manually:
```bash
curl -X POST http://localhost:8766/projects/YOUR_PROJECT_ID/events \
  -H "Content-Type: application/json" -H "X-API-Key: testkey" \
  -d "{\"event_type\":\"YOUR_EVENT\",\"payload\":{\"mock\":true}}"
```

**"I don't have working hardware"**
That's fine. Send mock events with `{"mock": true}` in the payload.
The contract is the interaction design. A mock event proving the loop is worth
the same grade points as real hardware.

**Validate your event payload before publishing:**
```bash
curl -X POST http://localhost:8766/contracts/validate \
  -H "Content-Type: application/json" \
  -d "{\"project_id\":\"YOUR_PROJECT_ID\",\"event_type\":\"YOUR_EVENT\",\"payload\":{...}}"
```

## What Carrie will see at critique

She will open `http://CLASSROOM_IP:8766/showcase/report`.

For each project she can see:
- Is it live right now? (has heartbeat in the last 2 minutes)
- Did it emit any events? (event_count)
- What did it claim to consume and emit? (contract)
- Did it leave evidence of a real consume → emit loop?

The demo script at `/showcase/demo-script` walks her through the run-of-show.
The roster CSV at `/projects/roster.csv` is the grade sheet export.

Your job is to make sure your row in that table shows:
- `has_heartbeat: true`
- `event_count > 0`
- `level: live` (at critique time)
